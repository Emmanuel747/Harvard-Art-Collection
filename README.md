# Harvard-Art-Collection
Developed an Online Art Gallery experience and an application programming interface that utilized the Harvard’s Art Museum’s database.

Utilizing the JS fetch method, I wrote various asynchronous functions to request images, objects, and arrays. A key feature was the ability for the user to search query and hide art listings with broken or missing images.
